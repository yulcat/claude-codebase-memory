## Codebase Memory

**Before reading any source code**, check if a domain file already covers it:
1. If you haven't read `memory/INDEX.md` yet this session, read it now.
2. If a relevant domain file exists, read it before opening source files.
3. Only read source code directly when no domain file covers it, or when you need detail beyond what's documented.

This applies throughout the session — not just at the start. Whenever you're about to explore a system or class, check memory first.

## Updating Memory

After completing a task, run `/document` to update the knowledge base.
You can optionally hint the domain: `/document SystemPopup`
