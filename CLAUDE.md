## Codebase Memory

At the start of each session:
1. Read `memory/INDEX.md`
2. Load only the domain files relevant to the current task

If no files are relevant, skip — don't load everything.

## Updating Memory

After completing a task, run `/document` to update the knowledge base.
You can optionally hint the domain: `/document SystemPopup`
