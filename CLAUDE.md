## Codebase Memory

Whenever you're about to explore a system or class, check memory first:
1. If you haven't read `memory/INDEX.md` yet this session, read it now.
2. If a relevant domain file exists, read it before diving into source files.

This applies throughout the session — not just at the start.

## Updating Memory

After completing a task, run `/document` to update the knowledge base.
You can optionally hint the domain: `/document SystemPopup`
